Expectations
1) What does our application do?

Our application is aimed to take care of the end-to-end process involved in finding investors for an idea/project. 
It will make the process easy for both the investor and the founder by providing a platform to pitch ideas (founder) and to find ideas to invest (investor).

2) What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

The investor has the right to privacy until he gets certain number of investors onboard to fund the idea/project.
The investment will proceed only if the idea has the potential to get a certain number of investors to fund for it and until the certain number of investors are onboard, the founder will not know any information about the investors or contact them in any way.

3) What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

The privacy of the investor is something critical in this application as we do not want the founder to contact the investor until certain number of investors are ready to invest in the idea/ project.
